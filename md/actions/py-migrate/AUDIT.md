## Phase Execution Log

### Plan: PLAN.md

| Phase | File | Action | Status | Verify Output | Pass/Fail |
|-------|------|--------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | `python/pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, requirements-dev.txt, .gitignore` | Create Python project scaffold | ✅ DONE | `Python 3.14.3` / `name = "cdd-sync-pro"` | ✅ PASS |
| 2 | `python/core/__init__.py, path_utils.py, binary_utils.py, serato_parser.py` | Implement binary parsing foundation | ✅ DONE | `Phase 2 core utils: ALL PASS` | ✅ PASS |
| 3 | `python/tests/__init__.py, test_path_utils.py, test_serato_parser.py` | Port JUnit tests to pytest, run round-trip suite | ✅ DONE | `17 passed in 0.02s` | ✅ PASS |
| 4 | `md/AGENT_LOG.md` | Update AGENT_LOG, stage all python/ files, commit + push | ✅ DONE | `2565db3 feat(python): scaffold py3...` | ✅ PASS |

Status values: `🔲 PENDING` → `⏳ IN FLIGHT` → `✅ DONE` / `⚠️ DEVIATION`

> **Orchestrator:** Read this table to find the first `🔲 PENDING` row — that is the next phase to dispatch.
> **Executing agent:** Fill in `Verify Output`, `Pass/Fail`, and `Status` immediately after each phase completes. Do not batch-fill at the end.

## Deviations

### Phase 3 — 2026-04-02 — RESOLVED

**FAILED tests/test_path_utils.py::TestNormalizePath::test_strips_volumes_prefix**
- Root cause: `_VOLUME_PREFIX_RE` used `^/Volumes/` (capital V) but `normalize_path()` lowercases before stripping, so the regex never matched.
- Fix: Added `re.IGNORECASE` to `_VOLUME_PREFIX_RE` in `path_utils.py`. Mirrors Java's `replaceAll("^/volumes/[^/]+/", "")` which runs post-lowercase.

**FAILED tests/test_serato_parser.py::TestCrateRoundTrip::test_synthetic_byte_round_trip**
- Root cause: `_build_synthetic_crate_bytes()` helper omitted `ovct` blocks, but `write_crate()` (correctly matching Java `writeTo()`) always emits 4 default columns when none were parsed.
- Fix: Added default `ovct` blocks to the synthetic builder. Both sides now agree on the byte layout. Java parity confirmed.
