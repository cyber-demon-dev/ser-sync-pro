# ===========================

# Mode: "cmd" for command-line, "gui" for GUI mode
mode = gui

# Path(s) to your music library root folder(s)
# Supports MULTIPLE paths separated by commas.
# Libraries are checked IN ORDER - first match wins.
# Example: /Volumes/Current/Crates, /Volumes/Vault/Crates, /Volumes/Archive/Music

music.library.filesystem = /Volumes/Current/Crates, /Volumes/Vault/Crates

# Path to your Serato folder containing History/Sessions
# -------------------------------------------------------
# IMPORTANT: This must point to the _Serato_ folder in your HOME directory!
# The History/Sessions folder ONLY exists in ~/Music/_serato_, NOT on external drives.
#
# On macOS: ~/music/_Serato_
# Example:  /Users/yourusername/Music/_serato_

music.library.serato = ~/music/_Serato_

# Create backup before fixing? (true/false)
# Highly recommended to leave enabled!
